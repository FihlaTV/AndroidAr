Android AR library

This is a small and lightweight android library for geo-marker based Augumented Reality based on several other frameworks. It's still a work in progress,
but the main features are working, see sample application for details.
The motivation behind this, is to make geographical Augumented Reality as simple as possible. You are free to use this in
both commercial and non-commercial projects.
